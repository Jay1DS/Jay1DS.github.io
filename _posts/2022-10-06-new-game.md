Introduction
--

With this assignment, I was to create a character from scratch, weither it's in 3D or 2D styles. Due to certain conditions, I was to make do from my home which would help with work efficenticy. For my work, I personally wanted to do this in 3D primarily. 

I used the following software to achieve my end results:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Autodesk Maya
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Adobe Media Encoder

That being said, for this assignment we'll be covering it in the following order: Concepting, Blocking out, Modelling, Sequencing, Polishing, Finalisation, and Project post-moderm.
