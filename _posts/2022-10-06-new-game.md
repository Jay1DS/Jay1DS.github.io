Introduction
--

With this assignment, I was to create a character from scratch, weither it's in 3D or 2D styles. Due to certain conditions, I was to make do from my home which would help with work efficenticy. For my work, I personally wanted to do this in 3D primarily. 

I used the following software to achieve my end results:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Autodesk Maya
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Adobe Media Encoder

That being said, for this assignment we'll be covering it in the following order: Concepting, Blocking out & Modelling, Sequencing, Polishing, Finalisation, and Project post-moderm.

Concepting
--

As it usaully goes, I got a firm idea of what I wanted to create while being debriefed on the assignment. With my assigned project, I wanted to use my interest in robots, electronics, sci-fi settings, and the use of intricate details. Before this, I had created a "basic" robotic character rig which helped with my introduction to 3D character rigging in Autodesk Maya, so with this project I wanted to upscale it, and push its known limits.

For my moodboard, I wanted list off what I wanted to achieve with the end product, then begin listing down a brainstorm, inspirations, and pin pointing reference images via a moodboard. Once I listed off my references and goals, I'd then start making a dozen character silhouettes to begin personalising the design. Then I'll make two refined designs and make a brief character background, as well as a simplified storyboard, mainly to list down the scene-by-scene breakdown of the animation in preperation for the next phases.

Blocking out & modelling
--

After making the moodboard on day one, then started making my character in Autodesk Maya. Blocking out the character was relitively easy. Went ahead with modelling, starting from the head, which I wanted to have three eyes with adjustable supports, small rotatable mandibles, a few rotatable joints and support pistons in the neck area, and a sharp design for the intimidation factor. The Design of the head would take some to nail down, whilst the core piece in the chest area, being that of the nuclear-particle-accelerent-coil-device or just the chest lazer, had been mostly comiled, with missing plating at the front and vented areas. Otherwise, the second day was just the start, with the begginnings of the head and chest areas.

On the third day, got the design of the head done, made adjustments to hip and chest areas, with added gurters and slidable blast doors for the chest lazer, added propulsion engines in various areas, and begun adding a reserve arm for the shoulder cannon, as well as making the arms and legs.
