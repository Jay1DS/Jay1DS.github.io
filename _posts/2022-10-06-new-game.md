Introduction
--

With this assignment, I was to create a character from scratch, weither it's in 3D or 2D styles. Due to certain conditions, I was to make do from my home which would help with work efficenticy. For my work, I personally wanted to do this in 3D primarily. 

I used the following software to achieve my end results:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Autodesk Maya
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Adobe Media Encoder

That being said, for this assignment we'll be covering it in the following order: Concepting, Blocking out, Modelling, Sequencing, Polishing, Finalisation, and Project post-moderm.

Concepting
--

As it usaully goes, I got a firm idea of what I wanted to create while being debriefed on the assignment. With my assigned project, I wanted to use my interest in robots, electronics, sci-fi settings, and the use of intricate details. Before this, I had created a "basic" robotic character rig which helped with my introduction to 3D character rigging in Autodesk Maya, so with this project I wanted to upscale it, and push its known limits.

For my moodboard, I wanted list off what I wanted to achieve with the end product, then begin listing down a brainstorm, inspirations, and pin pointing reference images via a moodboard. Once I listed off my references and goals, I'd then start making a dozen silhouettes to begin personalising the design. Then I'll make two refined designs and make a brief character background, as well as a simplified storyboard, mainly to list down the scene-by-scene breakdown of the animation.
