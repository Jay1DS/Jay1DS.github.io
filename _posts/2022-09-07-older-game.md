Timeframe: 4 weeks (5 days total)

Project scale: Solo/ one person

Type: College project

Introduction
--
The goal of this project was to make a polished final scene that showcases the skills that I've gained learning from industry standard software in a college enviroment.

The programs include the following:
* Autodesk Maya
* Adobe Photoshop
* Zbrush Core 2021


Pre-Production and Blockout
--
When starting this project, I wanted to put a focus on lighting and design. From that, and my interest in earth and space science, I decided to blockout a scene based around ancient ruins that surrounded a rotatable stone sundial since I can take a deep dive into the subjects which help in motivating me throughout the projects pipeline. In addition, I also wanted to add a varity of natural fauna to give it a worn look, and adding shallow water to lean into that theme.

Since it was a blockout, it was a quickly put together scene with built-in meshes, default textures, and basic poly edits like differences, extrudions, and mirroring. From this, I would begin modelling out the scene, and creating the textures for the scene.

Modeling and Texturing
--
This section of the pipeline production was the most time consuming, mainly deriving from modeling the enviroment meshes and compilling textures best suiited for the setting. I'll be discussing those processes and the eventual solutions to said problems. First was the enviroment meshes, as the main problem was that more meshes would equal to more processing power need to work in the scene. The base of scene is built on tiles and bricks which putted stress on the software, so to reduce the strain on the software, the main wall would use a enlarged texture that matched it to scale instead of using groups of brick meshes. However, by doing so I would end up spending a sizable time doing the brick wall texture. This single texture took a week and a half to work on, mainly because the scale of the texture crashing Adobe Photoshop. It was fun to complie the images needed to make the texture, but it took a while to make adjustments. Otherwise the first development or aulternatively refered to as "Past scene" was to make the core scene with the small water aquaducts, support pillars, tiling, the central sundial, as well as the floor layout.

After establishing the look and layout, the next development was to convert it to "Present Scene", which impliments the natural terrain, organic fauna, the jungle in the backround, and breaking down the core scene into a worn and natural state. Though, because there's no in-detail textures, the leafs on the trees don't allow light to enter the core scene, so a temporary transparent material was made so the scene can be lit up.

Next was to apply the all the textures need to make the scene appealing. Since I've been working on the texture work whilst modeling the scene, everything was already set to be used for material shading. The only real issue I would encounter was the stretching textures on curtain surfaces, especially that of the pillars. The solution to this problem was to attach the 2D texture to a 3D matrix, using a 3D texture asset like marble or granite to bind the nodes in hypershade. This method helps as it projects the texture in a 3D space instead of fitting the texture to individial faces. With that solution put in place, next up was to add proper lighting to the scene.

Lighting and Feedack
--

Firstly, lighting. With the lighting of the scene, I wanted to have scattered light at the center, with subtle lighting to make more of the scene visable. Rather simple process as it just requires adjustments to intensity, size, angle and location.

Once the lighting was put together, it was time to get the feedback. The mix of feedback was that of reflecting back at the work, as well as critiques from classmates and tutors. The following where put through:
* The floor was too shiny for an ancient ruin
* Texturing was inconsistant in some areas
* lighting was too contrasting
* Not enough natural fuana
* Meshes look too sharp

With that feedback, I started making changes. Most of the materials were updated to include more use of the 3D matrix, remade meshes for the bricks and tiles via zbrush core, added more folage to the scene, and made the needed adjustments to the lighting and material roughness.

Project Post-Moderm
--

From making this scene, it had its issues but proved indispencable for the gained experience. With What it had to work with and what I knew, I feel that I tried the my best. There are still a few minor issues with how the scene looks, but I would need to learn more about autodesk maya to smoothen those details out. Dispite that, I feel somewhat satisfied with end result I've got, and I am looking forward to making more scenes with the experience gained from projects like this.
