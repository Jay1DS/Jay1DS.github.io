Timeframe: 4 weeks


Introduction

The goal of this project was to make a polished final scene that showcases
the skills that I've gained learning from industry standard software in a
collage enviroment.

The programs include the following:
* Autodesk Maya
* Adobe Photoshop
* Zbrush Core 2021


Pre-Production and Blockout

When starting this project, I wanted to put a focus on lighting and design.
From that, and my interest in earth and space science, I decided to create
a scene based around ancient ruins that surrounded a rotatable stone sundial.
