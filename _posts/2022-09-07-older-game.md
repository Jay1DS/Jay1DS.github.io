Introduction

The goal of this project was to make a polished final scene that showcases the skills that I've gained learning from industry standard software in a collage enviroment.

The programs include the following:
* Autodesk Maya
* Adobe Photoshop
* Zbrush Core 2021

Pre-Production and Blockout

When starting this project, I wanted to put a focus on lighting and design. From that, and my interest in earth and space science, I decided to blockout a scene based around ancient ruins that surrounded a rotatable stone sundial since I can take a deep dive into the subjects which help in motivating me throughout the projects pipeline. In addition, I also wanted to add a varity of natural fauna to give it a worn look, and adding shallow water to lean into that theme.

Since it was a blockout, it was a quickly put together scene with built-in meshes, default textures, and basic poly edits like differences, extrudions, and mirroring. From this, I would begin modelling out the scene, and creating the textures for the scene.

Modeling and Texturing

This section of the pipeline production was the most time consuming, mainly deriving from modeling the enviroment meshes and compilling textures best suiited for the setting. I'll be discussing those processes and the eventual solutions to said problems. First was the enviroment meshes, as the main problem was that more meshes would equal to more processing power need to work in the scene. The base of scene is built on tiles and bricks which putted stress on the software, so to reduce the strain on the software, the main wall would use a enlarged texture that matched it to scale instead of using groups of brick meshes. However, by doing so I would end up spending a sizable time doing the brick wall texture. This single texture took a week and a half to work on, mainly because the scale of the texture crashing Adobe Photoshop. It was fun to complie the images needed to make the texture, but it took a while to make adjustments. Otherwise the first development or aulternatively refered to as "Past scene" was to make the core scene with the small water aquaducts, support pillars, tiling, the central sundial, as well as the floor layout.

After establishing the look and layout, the next development was to convert it to "Present Scene", which impliments the natural terrain, organic fauna, the jungle in the backround, and breaking down the core scene into a worn and natural state. Though, because there's no in-detail textures, the leafs on the trees don't allow light to enter the core scene, so a temporary transparent material was made so the scene can be lit up.
